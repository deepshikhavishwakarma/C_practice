-> A group of characters is called string. 
-> It is one dimensional character array. 
-> It is alpha-numeric. 
-> It is an implicit pointer. 
-> It is a derived data type. 


  Note:

     One byte should be left for Null char( \0 ). Otherwise we are getting garbage or junk
        values. Null char indicates string is completed. 
    -> String variable Size can’t be less than string. Otherwise we are getting error. 
    -> Using = operator, we can’t copy a string into another. We have to use strcpy() or copy character by character       manually. 
    -> Using == (comparison) operator, we can’t compare two strings. Use strcmp() or compare the characters one by one
      manually. 
      
            Syntax:
                    char variable [size] = “string”;

                    or
                    char variable[ ]=”string”;
                    Eg: char st[5] = “Rama”;

Note: String is implicit pointer because of string variable stores base address. String declaration methods:
                    
                    char st [5] = ”rama”; Ok

                    char st [20] = ” Naresh It”; Ok

                    char st [4] = { ‘r’,‘a’,‘m’ }; Ok --> char array. 
                    
                    char st[3]= “ram”; It gives garbage values in printing. 
                    
                    char st [3] = “rama”; error

                    char st[0]; error
                
                    char st[0]= ”abc”; Ok

                    char st[-5]; error
            
                    char st[5.5]; error

                    char st[5%3]; Ok -> char st[2];
                
                    char st[3+2]; -> st[5] -> Ok
            
                    char st[ ] = ”Ram”; Ok. 
                    
                    char st[ ] ; error
            
                    int n=20;
                    char st[n]; No

                    #define n 20

                    char st[n]; Ok

Note: String variable size always constant positive integer value.

gets(): It reads the string with spaces until pressing enter key. 

puts():It prints the given string with \n. they doesn’t need any conversion char or format specifiers. Hence they are called unformatted functions. 

Both belongs to <stdio.h>
