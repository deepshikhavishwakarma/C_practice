Program 3 ( Point 15 )

Write a c program to calculate the salary and based on that salary calculate the tax for the person

based on their designation by following few rules which are below


* 3 Type of Designation are there name as

 -> Developer

 (Indicated by D or d)

 -> Trainer 

 (Indicated by T or t)

 -> Manager 

 (Indicated by M or m)



[Note - For wrong designation print a message as "Invalid input".



* 3 Type of Extra Allowance are there which will be added in the salary 

 Home Allowance  =10000

 Food Allowance  =3000

 Travel Allowance =10000




* If the designation is Developer There salary will be calculated by adding 

 Total Salary= Salary + Home Allowance



 If the designation is Trainer There salary will be calculated by adding 

 Total Salary= Salary + Home Allowance + Food Allowance 



 If the designation is Manager There salary will be calculated by adding 

 Total Salary= Salary + Home Allowance + Food Allowance + Travel Allowance



* If the Total Salary is greater than 40000 then calculate the tax as 10% from the total salary 

 else 5% of total salary



[note: Take the Designation and salary from the user and based on the that 

    calculate Total Salary and also based on Total Salary calculate the tax].
[Note - For wrong designation print a message as "Invalid input".


* 3 Type of Extra Allowance are there which will be added in the salary 

 Home Allowance  =10000

 Food Allowance  =3000

 Travel Allowance =10000
