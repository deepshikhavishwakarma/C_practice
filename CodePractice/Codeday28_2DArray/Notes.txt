Two dimensional arrays:
Array with several rows and columns. Array with two subscripting operators [ ] [ ].
It is array of arrays. i.e. collection of one-dimensional
arrays.
It is implicit double pointer.
It is a n*n matrix. Syntax:
datatype variable [ rows ] [ columns ] = {elements} ;
Eg:
int a[ 2 ][ 3 ] = { { 10, 20 , 30 } , { 40 ,50, 60 } }

In two dimensional array the rows/first subscript
is working as array of pointers and they stores
first column address of each row. Hence it is an
implicit/internal double pointer. In the above example, To print the
first row, first column value, we have
to use

printf(“%d”
, a[0] [0]);  10
Internally how this statement is working ?
a[0] means value at a[0] i.e. 65500. 65500 + [0] col  65500 + 0 * 2  65500 
value at 65500 is 10.
