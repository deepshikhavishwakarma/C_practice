1. Develop a C program that takes an integer input and checks whether it is even or odd. Print "Even" if it's even, and "Odd" if it's odd.
Input as : 

Enter a Integer : 20
Output as : 

Even
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Create a C program that reads two integers from the user and prints "Equal" if they are equal, and "Not Equal" otherwise.

Input as :

Enter a number : 10 10
Output as :

Equal
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Write a C program to check whether a number is divisible by 5 and 11 or not.
Input as : 
Enter a number : 55
Output as : 

55 is divisible by both 5 and 11
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Develop a C program that reads a character from the user and prints "Vowel" if the character is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u or their uppercase equivalents), and "Consonant" if it's a consonant.

Input as : 

Enter a character : I

Output as :

Vowel
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Write a C program that takes an hour in the 24-hour format as input and identifies the time of day as "Morning," "Afternoon," "Evening," or "Night." Implement this using a series of if statements. Ensure that the program also checks for invalid input, displaying an appropriate message if the entered hour is not within the valid range (0-23). Present the program with a suitable title and header for clarity.

Input as :

Enter the hour (24-hour format): 13

Output as :

It's Afternoon.
