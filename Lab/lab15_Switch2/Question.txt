1. Write a C program to accept id from user and display department.

Id: 11 to 15 is Software department

  16 to 20 is Developer department

  21 to 23 is Management department


2. Write a C program that will ask for a person’s name and his/her game score. Then it will ask for a second person’s name and score. The program will print the winner’s name and also print by how many 

points that person won by comparing the scores. Develop this program by using switch case.

3. (Develop below program using switch case)

Write a C program that will read a float and a character from console. The character could be d for deposit or w for withdrawal.

Starting with a Minimum balance of 2000.



*Ask the user to initialize the minimum balance and don't allow 0 and -ve values if it is 0 or -ve then print "Ammount Can't be stored".



*If the user want deposit operation then ask how much ammount he want to deposit and add that ammount

 with balance and print the balance.

*if the user want withdrwal operation then ask how much ammount he want to withdrwal and substract that 

 ammount from the balance and print the balance.



[Note: If the deposit ammount is negetive or 0 print "Invalid ammount".

    If the withdrawl ammount is negetive , 0 or greater than balance then print "Invalid ammount"]



Hints:

-------

Declare variables for the amount in float, balance in float and transaction code in char types.



Test the transaction code, if ‘d’ it is deposit. Test the ammount so that it is not negative.

If the balance is not negative or positive sum-up

the balance.

balance = balance + amount;

Test the transaction code for withdrawal, ‘w’. If the transaction code is ‘w’

Minus the withdrawn amount to update the

balance.

balance = balance - amount;

And print the balance.
