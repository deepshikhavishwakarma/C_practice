1. Write a C program that takes a number as input from the user and determines whether it is a spy number of not, DEVELOP this by using while loop.

A Spy number is a number where the sum of its digits is equal to its product of its digits.



For Example : 

1124 is a spy number , because the sum of its digits is 1+1+2+4 = 8 and product of its digits is equal to 1*1*2*4 = 8.


2. Write a C program that takes a number as input from the user and determine whether the number is a neon number or not. Develop it by using while loop.

A Neon number is a number is a number where the sum of digits of square of the number is equal to the number itself.

For Example :

9 is a Neon number . Its square is 9*9 = 81 and sum of the digits 8+1 = 9 .So both are equal.


3.Write a C program to find the alternate digit sum is same or not.



Example-1 as: 12345



1+3+5=9

2+4=6



Output as: Alternate digit sum is not same.



Example-2 as: 12122

1+1+2=4

2+2=4



Output as : Alternate digit sum is same.
