 Food Allowance  =3000

 Travel Allowance =10000





* If the designation is Developer There salary will be calculated by adding 

 Total Salary= Salary + Home Allowance



 If the designation is Trainer There salary will be calculated by adding 

 Total Salary= Salary + Home Allowance + Food Allowance 



 If the designation is Manager There salary will be calculated by adding 

 Total Salary= Salary + Home Allowance + Food Allowance + Travel Allowance



* If the Total Salary is greater than 40000 then calculate the tax as 10% from the total salary
