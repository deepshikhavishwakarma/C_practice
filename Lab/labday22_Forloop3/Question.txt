1. Write a C program to find all Armstrong numbers between 100 to 999.

A three digit number is called Armstrong number if sum of cube of its digit is equal to number itself.

E.g.- 153 is an Armstrong number because (1)^3+(5)^3+(3)^3 = 153.


2. Write a program to check given number is Automorphic number or not.



  Example1: int n=25

  Output1 : 25 is Automorphic number.



  Example2: int n=7

  Output2 : 7 is Not a Automorphic number.

  

  Explanation : a number whose square ends in the same digits as the number itself.

  

  Example : 5,6,25 are automorphic numbers beacause 

       5*5=25 // last digit is 5

       6*6=36 // last digit is 6

       25*25=625 // last digits is 25 





3. Write a program in C to check whether a number can be expressed as the sum of two prime. 



Input as: 16



Expected Output :

16 = 3 + 13

16 = 5 + 11


4. Write a C program to find all strong numbers between 1 to 500.



A Strong number whose sum of each digit's factorial is the number itself.

example : 145 is an strong number.

Explanation : 1!=1

                      4!=24

                      5!=120



 So the sum of each digit factorial is 1+24+120 is equal to given input number that is 145. 
 


5. Write a program in C to find the prime Numbers Between the given range 100 to 999
