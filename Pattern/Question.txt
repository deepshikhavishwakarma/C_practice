                                    Write a C program to print square pattern program





Level 1-Write a C program to print square pattern program
Print a square pattern where each row alternates between 1 and 2.

Sample Input
5
Sample Output
1 2 1 2 1
2 1 2 1 2
1 2 1 2 1
2 1 2 1 2
1 2 1 2 1
Explanation
: Each row contains alternating 1s and 2s, starting with 1. This is done by checking if the column index is even or odd.

Level 2-Write a C program to print square pattern program
The program aims to print the sequence of numbers from 5 to 1, repeated a specific number of times (in this case, 5 times).

Sample Input
5
Sample Output
5 4 3 2 1
5 4 3 2 1
5 4 3 2 1
5 4 3 2 1
5 4 3 2 1
Explanation
Each row contains numbers from n down to 1, repeated for n rows. This is done by iterating from n to 1 for each row and column.


1. Write a C program to print a square pattern where each row contains the same digit and the digit increments with each row. The size of the square pattern is determined by the number of rows (or columns) which will be provided by the user.

Sample Input
5
Sample Output
1 1 1 1 1
2 2 2 2 2
3 3 3 3 3
4 4 4 4 4
5 5 5 5 5

Constraints:
The program should handle invalid inputs gracefully (i.e., inputs outside the specified range or non-integer inputs).
Explanation
1. The user inputs a positive integer ?? n. 2. The program prints a square pattern of size ?? × ?? n×n. 3. Each row ?? i (1-based index) contains the digit ?? i, repeated ?? n times.
