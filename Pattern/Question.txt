                                    Write a C program to print square pattern program



Level 1-Write a C program to print square pattern program
Print a square pattern where each row alternates between 1 and 2.

Sample Input
5
Sample Output
1 2 1 2 1
2 1 2 1 2
1 2 1 2 1
2 1 2 1 2
1 2 1 2 1
Explanation
: Each row contains alternating 1s and 2s, starting with 1. This is done by checking if the column index is even or odd.

Level 2-Write a C program to print square pattern program
The program aims to print the sequence of numbers from 5 to 1, repeated a specific number of times (in this case, 5 times).

Sample Input
5
Sample Output
5 4 3 2 1
5 4 3 2 1
5 4 3 2 1
5 4 3 2 1
5 4 3 2 1
Explanation
Each row contains numbers from n down to 1, repeated for n rows. This is done by iterating from n to 1 for each row and column.

Pattern Matching LVL 4
Write a c program to print given pattern

Sample Input
5
Sample Output
1 2 3 4 5
2 3 4 5 1
3 4 5 1 2
4 5 1 2 3
5 1 2 3 4
Constraints:
.
Explanation
The outer loop (for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++)) iterates through each row. The inner loop (for (int j = 0; j < rows; j++)) prints numbers in each row, calculated using modular arithmetic to achieve the cyclic pattern ((i + j) % rows + 1).




Pattern Matching LVL 5
Write a c program for the following pattern

Sample Input
5
Sample Output
1 2 3 4 5
0 3 4 5 6
0 0 5 6 7
0 0 0 7 8
0 0 0 0 9
Constraints:
.
Explanation
The outer loop (for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++)) iterates through each row. The inner loop (for (int j = 0; j < rows; j++)) prints numbers in each row based on the pattern logic. If j (column index) is less than i (row index), it prints 0 indicating positions that are not incremented. Otherwise, it prints j - i + 1, which calculates the number starting from 1 and incrementing for each position.




Pattern Matching LVL 6
Write a c program for the following pattern

Sample Input
4
Sample Output
1
1 * 2
1 * 2 * 3
1 * 2 * 3 * 4
Constraints:
.
Explanation
Each line in the output corresponds to an iteration of a loop. The outer loop controls the number of lines printed, iterating from 1 to 4 in this case. For each iteration i, an inner loop runs from 1 to i, printing numbers followed by an asterisk (*) to separate them. The numbers start from 1 and increment sequentially up to i.

1. Write a C program to print a square pattern where each row contains the same digit and the digit increments with each row. The size of the square pattern is determined by the number of rows (or columns) which will be provided by the user.

Sample Input
5
Sample Output
1 1 1 1 1
2 2 2 2 2
3 3 3 3 3
4 4 4 4 4
5 5 5 5 5

Constraints:
The program should handle invalid inputs gracefully (i.e., inputs outside the specified range or non-integer inputs).
Explanation
1. The user inputs a positive integer ?? n. 2. The program prints a square pattern of size ?? × ?? n×n. 3. Each row ?? i (1-based index) contains the digit ?? i, repeated ?? n times.
