Operator is a special symbol used to do a particular task [ 
work ]. C comes with 44 operators and 14 separators.
Operator works on operands. Based on no of operands 
participating in operation, the operators divided into 3 
types.
1.Unary operator:
  Require one operand.
  Eg: a++, a--, ++a, --a, sizeof(a), +a, -a, ~a, !a,…
2.Binary operators: Require two operands.
  Eg: a+b, a-b, a>b, a<=b, a!=b, a<<b, a>>b,…
3. Ternary / conditional operator [?:]: Require 3 
  operands or expressions.
  Eg: Condition part ? true part : false part;
  Based on operation the operators divided into several 
  types.
1.Assignment operator [ = ]: It copies the value on its 
  right side into the variable on its left side. In 
  assignment operation, the left side operand should 
  be a variable. i.e. constants or expressions not 
  allowed on left side.
  Eg: 
     a=10;
     b=1.2;
     c=’x’;
     d=”abc”;  Error because of “abc” is a string
     10=20;  Error because of 10 is a constant
     10+20  30=30  Error
    Note: Always expression evaluates constant value. 
     Hence left side expressions not allowed.
    c=10+20;
    a=b=c=100
