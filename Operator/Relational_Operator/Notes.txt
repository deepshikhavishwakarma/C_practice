Relational operators 
[ == ( comparison), <, >, <=, >=, != ( not equal ) ]:
They are used to check the given condition / expression is true or false. If condition true always 
the result is 1 and condition false always the result is 0.

Logical operators 

1.&& - and
2.|| - or
3.! – not
&&, || operators used to combine two or more 
expressions into a single expression.
! used for negation i.e. true become false and false 
become true
Note: In C other than 0 anything is 1 i.e. true.
